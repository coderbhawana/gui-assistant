# GUI Assistant Python Project

## Overview
-------------------
Welcome to the GUI Assistant Python Project! This repository contains the code for a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) assistant designed to enhance user interaction and simplify tasks through an intuitive interface.

### **Features:**
-------------------
***Speech Recognition: Utilizes the speech_recognition module to recognize user's speech through the microphone, enabling seamless communication with the assistant.***

***Text-to-Speech: Implements pyttsx3 to convert the assistant's responses into speech, allowing it to interact audibly with the user.***

***Wikipedia Search: Enables users to query information from Wikipedia by using the wikipedia module to access relevant summaries.***

***YouTube Music Player: Allows users to play their favorite songs on YouTube by utilizing the pywhatkit module to search and play music videos.***

***Web Browsing: Provides convenient access to YouTube and Google using the webbrowser module, allowing users to open these sites quickly.***

***Joke Generator: Amuses users with jokes retrieved from the pyjokes module.***

***Current Time Display: Informs users of the current time through voice feedback using the datetime module.***

***Location Search: Assists users in locating places through Google Maps with the help of the webbrowser module.***

***User Interaction: The assistant prompts users to enter their names and greets them accordingly, creating a personalized experience.***

### **Instructions for GUI:**
-------------------------------
***Click the "Start Voice Assistant" button to initiate the assistant's operation.***

***Once started, users can communicate with the assistant using voice commands.***

***Saying "exit" stops the assistant and displays a gratitude message.***

***Users can restart the assistant by clicking the button again.***
